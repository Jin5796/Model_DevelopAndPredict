The four folders represent the four different models. 
The Python files with the suffix *develop* contain the code used for model construction, 
while those with the suffix *prediction* correspond to the final optimized models, which can be used to predict new data. 
The datasets used in the code are also included in each folder and can be matched by their filenames. 
To predict new data, you will need to first calculate the required molecular descriptors following the steps described in the article, 
and then input them into the *prediction* code.
